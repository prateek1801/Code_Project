    "   - **Left-Tailed Test:**\n",

    "#### - important:-\n",

    "   - **Right-Tailed Test:**\n",
    "     - Null Hypothesis (H₀): (H₁): μ <= specified value\n",
    "#### important:-\n",
    "     - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): μ > specified value\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical Region:**\n",
    "   - **Left-Tailed Test:** The critical region is on the left side of the distribution. You would reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls in this left tail.\n",
    "   - **Right-Tailed Test:** The critical region is on the right side of the distribution. You would reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls in this right tail.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **P-Value Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Left-Tailed Test:** The p-value represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Smaller p-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ## p_value =  norm.cdf(np.abs(z_statistic))\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Right-Tailed Test:** Similarly, the p-value represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed. Again, smaller p-values suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##  p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(np.abs(z_statistic))\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "   - **Left-Tailed Test:** Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than or equal to the chosen significance level (alpha).\n",
    "   - **Right-Tailed Test:** Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than or equal to the chosen significance level (alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on comparing the p-value to a predetermined significance level. The choice between left-tailed and right-tailed testing depends on the specific question and the direction of interest in your hypothesis.\n",
